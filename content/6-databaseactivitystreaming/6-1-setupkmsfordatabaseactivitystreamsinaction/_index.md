**Database Activity Streaming** requires a Master Key to encrypt the key that in turn encrypts the logged database activity. The Default AWS RDS KMS key canâ€™t be used as the Master key. Therefore, we need to create a new customer managed KMS key to configure the Database Activity Streaming.

#### Create KMS Key
1. Open [KMS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms/home)  and select **Customer Managed Keys** on the left-hand side and click on **Create Key**:
2. On the next screen under Configure key choose **Symmetric** key type and click **Next**:

3. On the next screen, under **Add Labels** give a name for the key under the field **Alias** such as ``cmk-apg-lab``.

- Under Description field, type a description for the key such as ``Customer managed Key for Aurora PostgreSQL Database Activity Streaming (DAS) lab`` and click Next.

4. On the next screen under **Define Key Administrative permissions** and  **Define key usage permissions**, leave with default setting.

5. On the next screen, review the policy and click **Finish**.
