**Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL** is a fully managed, PostgreSQL–compatible, and ACID–compliant relational database engine that combines the speed, reliability, and manageability of Amazon Aurora with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. Aurora PostgreSQL is a drop-in replacement for PostgreSQL and makes it simple and cost-effective to set up, operate, and scale your new and existing PostgreSQL deployments, thus freeing you to focus on your business and applications. To learn more about Aurora in general, see [What is Amazon Aurora?.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html)

In addition to the benefits of Aurora, **Aurora PostgreSQL** offers a convenient migration pathway from Amazon RDS into Aurora, with push-button migration tools that convert your existing RDS for PostgreSQL applications to Aurora PostgreSQL. Routine database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection, and repair are also easy to manage with Aurora PostgreSQL.

**Aurora PostgreSQL** can work with many industry standards. For example, you can use Aurora PostgreSQL databases to build HIPAA-compliant applications and to store healthcare related information, including protected health information (PHI), under a completed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with AWS.

**Aurora PostgreSQL** is FedRAMP HIGH eligible. For details about AWS and compliance efforts, see [AWS services in scope by compliance program.](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)
